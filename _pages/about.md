I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/), broadly interested in galaxy evolution and the physical processes that shape galaxies across cosmic time.

On the simulation side, I develop and apply radiative transfer methods using the [SKIRT](https://skirt.ugent.be) code to generate realistic synthetic observations of simulated galaxies, covering dust emission, ionized gas, and emission lines. I am the lead developer of [TODDLERS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/526/3/3871/7287615), a UV-to-millimetre emission library for star-forming regions integrated within SKIRT. This work enables direct comparisons between cosmological simulations and photometric and spectroscopic surveys across the full electromagnetic spectrum.

On the observational side, I work with [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid) data to study galaxy morphology. My recent work exploits Euclid's Early Release Observations of the Perseus cluster to investigate the isophotal shapes of cluster dwarf galaxies, identifying tidally transformed systems through a novel cumulative light-fraction approach.
