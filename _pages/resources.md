### TODDLERS

[toddlers.ugent.be](https://toddlers.ugent.be)

TODDLERS (Time evolution of Observables including Dust Diagnostics and Line Emission from Regions containing young Stars) is a library of spectral energy distributions and other observables for star-forming regions, computed with [SKIRT](https://skirt.ugent.be). The data are distributed as SciPy interpolator objects for direct use in Python. The library is described in [Kapoor et al. (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/526/3/3871/7287615).

### SKIRT-Auriga synthetic observations

[auriga.ugent.be](https://auriga.ugent.be)

This portal hosts synthetic multi-wavelength images and broadband photometry for Milky Way-type galaxies from the Auriga simulation suite, produced with [SKIRT](https://skirt.ugent.be). Images span ultraviolet to submillimetre wavelengths and are available for multiple viewing angles. The data release is described in [Kapoor et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06595).
