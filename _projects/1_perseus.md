Using Euclid's Early Release Observations of the Perseus cluster, I study the isophotal shapes of dwarf galaxies to identify tidally transformed systems. I develop a novel cumulative light-fraction approach for measuring the $$c_4$$ Fourier coefficient, which is more robust than traditional fixed-surface-brightness methods for low-surface-brightness dwarfs. Combined with synthetic Euclid observations of N-body simulations, this work connects observed boxy morphologies to specific tidal transformation histories.

_In preparation._
