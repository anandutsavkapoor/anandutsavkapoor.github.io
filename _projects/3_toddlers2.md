TODDLERS 2.0 is a major extension of the [TODDLERS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/526/3/3871/7287615) framework, which models UV-to-mm emission from star-forming regions by combining 1D shell dynamics with radiative transfer post-processing. New capabilities include a continuous star formation mode via temporal convolution, integration of [pySTARBURST99](https://github.com/Hawcroft2025) for flexible IMF specification, binary stellar evolution via BPASS, stochastic stellar population sampling for low-mass clusters, and support for arbitrary cloud density profiles including modified Bonnor-Ebert spheres.

_In preparation._
